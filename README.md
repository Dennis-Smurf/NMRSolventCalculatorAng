**NMRSolventCalculator** calculates solvent residues in a NMR spectrum and is based on [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org/) and [Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.io/bootstrap/). 

The goal of this project for me was to get acquainted with AngularJS and bootstrap.

This little website runs local and it calculates the mass percentages of the solvents you pick.
